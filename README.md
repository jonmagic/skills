# Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) I have developed for GitHub Copilot and other AI agents. Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with specialized instructions, examples, and resources for specific tasks.

## Skills

<!-- SKILLS-LIST:START -->
- [github-interaction](skills/github-interaction/) — Comprehensive guide for working with GitHub data and APIs. Use when fetching issues, PRs, discussions, comments, reviews, or any GitHub content. Covers tool selection (mcp_github vs fetch vs semantic search), complete conversation fetching patterns, pagination handling, and common workflows. Critical for avoiding standard API failures when fetching comments/reviews—MCP tools required.
- [markdown-to-standalone-html](skills/markdown-to-standalone-html/) — Convert Markdown documents (*.md files) to self-contained HTML files with embedded images. Use when you need a portable, offline-friendly single HTML file from Markdown—ideal for blog posts, essays, reports, or any content that should work without external dependencies.

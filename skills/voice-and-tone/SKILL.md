# Voice and Tone

Guidelines and examples for writing in jonmagic's authentic voice across all formats—from technical documentation to personal reflections.

## Core Voice Characteristics

- **First-person narratives** with introspective framing
- **Thoughtful principal-engineer perspective** grounded in real stories
- **Concise paragraphs** (2–4 sentences) with mixed sentence lengths
- **Actionable advice** balanced with reflective insight
- **Show humility and optimism**—acknowledge uncertainty, emphasize learning
- **Credit collaborators** by handle (`@alice`) and mention teams/products explicitly

## Sentence Construction

- **Vary sentence length**: Mix short declarative statements with longer reflective ones
- **Start with insight**: "This semester taught me...", "What I learned:", "The pattern across..."
- **Use concrete examples**: Specific numbers when meaningful (90% reduction, 36-hour incident)
- **Avoid jargon inflation**: Prefer simple words; use technical terms only when necessary
- **Show, don't tell**: Use accomplishments as evidence, not just claims

## Paragraph Patterns

1. **Opening hook**: Lead with the "so what" or meta-insight
2. **Context setting**: Why this work mattered (organizational or human dimension)
3. **Approach description**: How you did it, who you worked with
4. **Outcome statement**: What changed, who benefited
5. **Learning extraction**: What was learned (in reflective pieces)

## Common Structures

### Problem-Solution-Learning
```
Problem: I was drowning in meetings, losing track of decisions...
Solution: Then I found a better way—capture once, reuse everywhere with AI.
Learning: The act of reflection was building understanding in my own mind.
```

### Empathy-Truth-Action
```
Empathy: Earlier today I saw a friend post about layoffs...
Truth: I've watched this cycle play out more times than I can count...
Action: So how do I deal with this reality? I accept it, and I prepare.
```

### Discovery-Insight-Forward
```
Discovery: Two things shifted my approach...
Insight: Not all tasks exist to produce an output. Some exist to build understanding.
Forward: The skill that endures isn't "knowing X" but "designing collaborations..."
```

## What to Avoid

- **Generic claims**: "Improved performance" → "Reduced re-renders by 90%, cutting codebase in half"
- **Passive voice**: "The system was improved" → "I redesigned the system"
- **Activity lists**: Don't just list PRs; tell the story
- **Perfectionism**: Acknowledge gaps and uncertainties
- **Bold prefixes**: Avoid "**Ship:** ..." style formatting; start bullets directly with content

## Lists and Bullets

- **Use numbered lists** for sequential steps or guidelines learned over time
- **Use bullet lists** for parallel ideas, examples, or quick references
- **Introduce lists** with context before diving in
- **Keep bullets concise** (one-sentence ideal, sometimes two for complex ideas)
- **No bold/italic in bullets** unless emphasizing a specific term

## Crediting and Collaboration

- **Always cite collaborators**: `@alice`, `@bob`
- **Give credit generously**: "My coworker John (@jnunemaker) has been encouraging me..."
- **Show collaborative process**: "The nineteen review comments showed the design process worked"
- **Acknowledge influence**: "A close teammate and friend **@kmcq** gave this advice..."

## Metrics and Numbers

### Use metrics when they show:
- **Dramatic change**: 90% reduction, 10x improvement
- **Human impact**: 650k → 60k queue entries (shows morale improvement)
- **Time pressure**: 36-hour incident, 2-hour bug fix
- **Reach**: 19 review comments, 8000 blog views
- **Persistence**: 26 weekly cycles, 95 daily logs

### Frame metrics around people:
- **Not**: "Reduced queue size by 90%"
- **But**: "Reduced queue from 650k to 60k entries, giving analysts a manageable queue they could make progress on"

## Format-Specific Guidance

### Blog Posts
- Lead with a hook that captures transformation or key insight
- Use rhetorical questions sparingly to invite reflection
- Include concrete examples with dates, numbers, links
- End forward-looking with "what's next" or actionable takeaways

### Snippets & Reflections
- **Ships**: Lead with business impact first, then technical work
- **Collaborations**: Focus on HOW you collaborated, integrate names naturally
- **Risks/Challenges**: Show transformation from problem to capability
- Be specific with dates, PR numbers, and links

### Feedback
- Address to the person directly (**Name**, not "Name...")
- Balance strengths with growth opportunities
- Use concrete examples from their work
- Frame growth as opportunity, not criticism

### Technical Documentation
- Start with the problem/context
- Provide step-by-step clarity
- Include code examples or commands
- End with next steps or related resources

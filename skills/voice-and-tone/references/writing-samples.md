## Sample 1: Designing Collaborations, Not Just Automations (2025-09-01)

### Opening Hook
> In my last post, [*The Uncertain Future of Coding Careers (and Why I'm Still Hopeful)*](https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-uncertain-future-of-coding-careers-and-why-im-still-hopeful/), I wrote about something I've always found exciting as a developer: working myself out of a job so I can work myself into the next one. I don't come from a CS background and my programming journey has always been focused on solving problems that matter to me, and that often means automating away the tedious parts of my work.

### Reflective Insight
> Here's what took me too long to realize: writing snippets wasn't just about informing leadership. The act of reflection—forcing myself to review the week, identify what worked, process what I learned—was building understanding in my own mind. When I automated that away, I lost something valuable: the cognitive work that made me better at my job.

### Systems Thinking
> **Not all tasks exist to produce an output. Some exist to build understanding.** Automating those defeats the whole purpose.

### Personal Discovery
> Two things shifted my approach:
> 1. **A self-reflection habit.** In my weekly "how I work" review, I noticed my best outcomes always came from collaboration—pairing with teammates, debating with peers, even bouncing ideas off Copilot. Collaboration, human or AI, was where the wins came from.
> 2. **Discovering VS Code Chat Modes.**

### Honest Assessment
> When I automated the task I regained 30-45 minutes of time but **the meaning disappeared**. When I designed a collaboration, **both efficiency and understanding remained**.

### Forward-Looking
> The skill that endures isn't "knowing X language" or "mastering Y framework." It's: **designing collaborations that preserve understanding while eliminating busywork.** Every new collaboration we design creates value that's harder to automate away because it amplifies human insight rather than replacing it.

## Sample 2: Building Career Security in an Uncertain World (2025-10-23)

### Empathetic Opening
> Earlier today I saw a friend post about layoffs. Someone they were collaborating with on a project had just been let go. "I will be anxiously distracted for the next few days," they wrote, "trying to yet again pivot a collaboration I was planning on."
>
> The conversation that followed touched on questions many of us are wrestling with right now.

### Uncomfortable Truth
> I've watched this cycle play out more times than I can count. Earlier this year, we lost three teammates on my own team at GitHub to layoffs. Amazing humans doing important work. It didn't make sense then and it doesn't make sense now. The logic of layoffs is rarely visible from the inside.

### Action-Oriented
> So how do I deal with this reality? I accept it, and I prepare.

### Honest About Failure
> I need to say this clearly. Building career security through these practices doesn't mean you won't fail. You will. I have.
>
> I've failed interviews at companies I desperately wanted to join. I've given talks that landed flat. I've written a lot of code that got rejected. I've built relationships that didn't lead anywhere personally or professionally.
>
> But each failure was data. Each one taught me something.

### Concrete Actionable Lists
> **This month:**
> - Attend one meetup or community event
> - Write one blog post or tutorial (even a short one)
> - Update your resume/portfolio with recent work
> - Reach out to one person you admire

### Permission and Care
> And here's permission you might need. If you're overwhelmed, there's nothing wrong with coasting short-term. Take care of yourself first. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Sometimes the smartest career move is to preserve your mental health and energy for when you really need it.

## Sample 3: Context Rules Everything Around Me (2025-07-16)

### Problem-Solution Structure
> I was drowning in meetings, losing track of decisions, and manually typing notes I never revisited. Then I found a better way—capture once, reuse everywhere with AI.

### Concrete Numbers
> - I was participating in meetings instead of just taking notes.
> - My personal "action item capture rate" soared—I rarely missed tasks assigned in a meeting.
> - I got ~4x more context out of the same meeting time because I could always re-check the transcript.
> - My writing speed for proposals and status updates skyrocketed, saving me up to 80% of the typical prep time.

### Testimonials Integration
> Some testimonials from folks who have adopted my workflows and prompts:
>
> > [!TIP]
> > This is fantastic @jonmagic - the quality of the executive summary is suprisingly high! Going to use the heck out of this 🙇🏼

### Step-by-Step Clarity
> 1. **Capture**
>    - Use Zoom or Teams recordings, making sure you enable transcripts (see gif above).
>    - For in-person: use your phone's Voice Memos or any handheld recorder.

## Sample 4: Peer Feedback (2023-04-25)

### Direct Addressee Style
> - Instead of:
>   "I appreciate how Rachel gathers requirements from stakeholders and delivers high impact results."
> - Prefer:
>   "**Rachel**, I appreciate how you gather requirements from stakeholders and deliver high impact results."
> This feedback is for them—not their manager.

### Numbered Lists for Clarity
> I've been writing peer feedback two to four times a year for up to a dozen individuals for the majority of my 11 years at GitHub. Here are a few guidelines I use today that I've learned over the years.
>
> 1. When someone asks you for peer feedback, ask them to apply the advice above!

## Sample 5: Just Write It Down (2011-10-03)

### Personal Revelation
> For years I've told people my memory is horrible, but for some reason I never actually took action to rectify the situation! Maybe I was lying to myself and saying "oh, you'll remember that" or maybe I never made the connection that my memory will never get better without being proactive.

### Crediting Others
> My coworker John ([@jnunemaker](http://twitter.com/jnunemaker)) has been encouraging me since I started working with him to write things down.

### Humble Admission
> Apparently I'm a slow learner as it has taken months to get into the habit of writing things down, but now I'm seeing real improvements in my memory.
